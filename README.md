# DL_mini_projects
This repository contains two mini-projects for the EPFL deep learning course (EE-559), Spring 2021.

# Project 1: Digit Image classification task with weight sharing and auxiliary losses
This  projects  aims  at  testing  different  architectures  tocompare  two  digits  visible  in  a  two-channel  image.  Moreprecisely  the  purpose  is  to  asses  the  performance  improve-ment that can be achieved with the use of weight sharing orthe use of an auxiliary losses.The goal is to get a series of 2×14×14 tensors, correspondingto  pairs  of  14  ×  14  gray-scale  images  and  with  the  deepnetworks  that  we  will  implement,  predict  for  each  pair  ifthe first digit is lesser or equal to the second.
