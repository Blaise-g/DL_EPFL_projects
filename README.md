# DL_mini_projects
This repository contains two mini-projects for the EPFL deep learning course (EE-559), Spring 2021.

# Project 1: Digit Image classification task with weight sharing and auxiliary losses
The first  project (whose report can be found [here](/Proj1/report.pdf)  aims  at  testing  different  architectures  tocompare  two  digits  visible  in  a  two-channel  image.  Moreprecisely  the  purpose  is  to  asses  the  performance  improve-ment that can be achieved with the use of weight sharing orthe use of an auxiliary losses. The goal is to get a series of 2×14×14 tensors, correspondingto  pairs  of  14  ×  14  gray-scale  images  and  with  the  deepnetworks  that  we  will  implement,  predict  for  each  pair  if first digit is lesser or equal to the second.

# Project 2: Mini "Deep Learning Framework"
The second project (whose report can be found [here](.pdf) consistend on implementing a DL framework from scratchì using only Pytorch’s tensor operations and the standard math library hence in particular not being allowed to leverage autograd or the neural-network modules.
